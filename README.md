# Team Whis (Battlecode 2022)
Created by Christy Jestin and David Liu

All of the code we wrote can be found under /scr/whisplayer1. Note that the static keyword doesn't actually make properties/methods static in Battlecode (this was part of the rules and was setup by competition staff - not sure how). Instead all robots had to communicate using a shared array of 64 integers with each integer in the range \[0,2^16). Robots were further restricted by bytecode limits (i.e. how many atomic instructions each bot could execute per turn).
